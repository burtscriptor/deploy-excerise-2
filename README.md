# The joys of deploying

## Purpose
This small project was to created to practise solving deployment issues related to a "Mixed content" errors while trying to deploy ISS-Locator/ Space Station Tracker.
It contains a small backend server/ proxy to serve up data to front end. This solved the error.

I also experimented with a procfile as well as making changes to the package.json scripts as per suggestions from Stackover flow.
I cant recall what benefits these experiments had if any in the end.
